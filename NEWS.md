# KScorrect 1.1.0
* Steve Wang re-wrote qmixnorm to improve performance and make the function more compatible with behavior in other quantile functions, such as qnorm.
* Corrected behavior when single 'sd' specified in mixture model functions so that results in equal-variance mixture model, and calls warning to alert to behavior

# KScorrect 1.0.0
* First release. Updates to follow with future releases.
