Description: Implements the Lilliefors-corrected Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for
    use in goodness-of-fit tests, suitable when population parameters are unknown
    and must be estimated by sample statistics. Uses a resampling algorithm to
    estimate p-values from the resampling distribution. Can be used with a variety
    of continuous distributions, including normal, lognormal, univariate mixtures
    of normals, uniform, loguniform, exponential, gamma, and Weibull distributions.
    Functions to generate random numbers and calculate density, distribution,
    and quantile functions are provided for use with the loguniform and mixture
    distributions.
